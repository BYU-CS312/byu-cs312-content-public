## Guidelines

Homework is from the text unless otherwise stated. Homework is due at the beginning of class on the assigned day.

It is very important to stay current in this class and these assignments are selected to help you do so. 

What you have to say is an important skill you will use throughout your career. 
All assignments are to be neat and professional. 
If you cannot clearly communicate something, there is a good chance that you do not yet understand it well.

Assignments will be graded on accuracy, completeness and clarity.
Good writing, grammar, punctuation, etc. are extremely important because of the great effect they have on the impact of your work.
