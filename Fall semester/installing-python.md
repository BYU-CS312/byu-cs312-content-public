# Installing Python

There are many ways to install and configure python. We recommend the following:

1. [Install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links)
2. Create a miniconda environment to use in this course
   ```
   conda create -n cs312 python=3.8 pyqt=5
   ```

## IDE

We recommend either [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Either can be configured to use the conda environment you created.
