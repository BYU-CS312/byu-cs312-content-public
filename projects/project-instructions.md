# Project Instructions

There will be 5 individual programming projects throughout the semester and one final group 
project. For each project, you will solve a concrete problem by implementing an algorithm 
in such a way as to meet a conservative performance requirement. A reasonable implementation 
will sail through the performance requirement. You will prepare a typed report electronically 
according to the guidelines for each project. You will answer questions posed in the project 
guidelines and usually report the results of an empirical analysis of your algorithm. All 
project reports should include a copy of your documented source code and a screenshot 
demonstrating the working algorithm. 


All projects will be done in Python.


For each project, you will be required to turn in your code. In each project, be sure to always **document your algorithm with legible comments** in important places in your code that make it obvious to the reader what your solution is doing. **Note the time/space complexity** of each key portion of your code. This documentation also provides evidence of your comprehension. With the aid of adequate documentation, the correctness of your approach should be easy for the reader (e.g., TA) to verify. 

If your code spans multiple files, make sure that you include all of it, and make sure that it is organized in a way that makes it easy for the reader (TA) to follow.


## Design Experience

In this class, you are learning the importance of solving a problem and analyzing the solution before you start writing code. For each project, you are required to have a "design experience" 
**after** reading the project instructions but **before** writing any code.


This experience might best be done using a whiteboard to walk through the solution with 
a one- (or more-) person technical audience, with that person being a CS 312 classmate, 
another CS major or another technical person with an eye for detail. Make sure you sketch 
out and understand how to represent a problem instance (both inputs and outputs) and how 
to map from inputs to outputs (your algorithm). Simulate simple examples and a non-trivial 
example or two with your marker. Think out loud. Listen to your audience as he or she 
poses questions or identifies potential complications. In short, **make sure you understand what you are going to do before you write a stitch of code**. If two students reciprocate 
for one another, then each person should take a turn as presenter and as audience member. 
There are other possible approaches to this design experience as well, including 
back-of-a-napkin illustrations, writing pseudocode, etc. The purpose of your design 
experience is to get the concept of a working solution out in front of yourself 
(and possibly other thoughtful people). If you don’t have a solution that appears to work 
and hold up to scrutiny, then your design experience is not complete. Don’t code without 
clear thinking up front.


For each design experience, you will complete a simple quiz in 
[Canvas](https://canvas.byu.edu/) by briefly describing and 
evaluating the quality of your experience. Due dates for these quizes are shown on the 
[schedule](../schedule.md); quizes will open one week before the due date and 
close at 11:59pm on the date they are due. Late design experiences are not accepted, but 
if you are late you should go through the process anyhow before writing code. Each project's 
design experience has a submission deadline on the course schedule about a week and a half 
before the project report submission due date (except for the first project), but you are 
encouraged to finish the design experience as early as possible. The design experience 
will be worth 10% of your project grade.



## Projects


1. [Primality Test](project1-fermat/Fermat.md): The purpose of this project
 is to get you up and running and familiarize you with Python/PyQT. You will also gain experience with algorithms for modular arithmetic. In this project, you will implement the prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem.
1. [Convex Hull](project2-convex-hull/ConvexHull.md): In this project, you will implement 
a divide and conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points and you will 
analyze the algorithm both theoretically and empirically.
1. [Network Routing](project3-network-routing/NetworkRouting.md): In this project you will 
implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to find paths through a graph representing a network routing 
problem. You will use two different data structures to implement a priority queue in order 
to see that both algorithm design \*and\* data structure implementation significantly affect 
performance.
1. [Gene Sequencing](project4-gene-sequencing/GeneSequencing.md): In this project, you will 
implement two versions of a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the minimal cost 
of aligning gene sequences and extracting (an) optimal alignment. In the process, you 
will learn a little bit about computational genomics and how domain knowledge can affect 
algorithm design.
1. [Traveling Salesperson](project5-tsp/TSP.md): In this project, you will 
implement a branch and bound algorithm to find solutions to the traveling salesperson 
problem (TSP) and get your first taste of dealing with NP-completeness.
1. [LeetCode Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PdPCN3vfkQboSjYg-g8PrHbexOTWMvejhw2GX5L2spw/edit?usp=sharing) Details will be available early next week (by April 1st).


### Submissions

All project reports should be submitted in PDF format via Gradescope (accessed via Canvas) on or before the published 
due date, except the group project which is due as a hardcopy at the beginning of class 
on the day you present your group project.
