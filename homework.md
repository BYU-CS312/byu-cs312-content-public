## CS 312 Homework Guidelines

Submit each homework as a PDF file through Learning Suite before 7:45am on the due date.  Plan on submitting early (e.g. night before) as sometimes there are glitches when you try to submit just before the due time. 

Show your work.  That can also allow you get partial credit if your answer is wrong. Communicating clearly and concisely what you have to say is an important skill you will use throughout your career. Good writing, grammar, punctuation, etc. are important.  All written assignments are to be neat and professional. Homework may be handwritten and scanned as a PDF if you wish. Review all PDFs after submitting to ensure they are easily legible.

| <a id='3'>3</a> | 1 | 1.18 (2), 1.20 (5), 1.27 (3) |
| <a id='4'>4</a> | 2 | 2.4 (3), 2.5(a-e, only find bounds using the master theorem. You may use big-O as that has the same results as big-Θ in this case) (5), 2.17 (2) |
| <a id='5'>5</a> | 2 | 2.19 (5), 2.23 (5) |
| <a id='6'>6</a> | 3 | 3.1 (4), 3.2 (6) (Show DFS forest and all edges in forest) |
| <a id='7'>7</a> | 3 | 3.3 (4), 3.4 (6) |
| <a id='8'>8</a> | 4 | 4.1 (10) |
| <a id='9'>9</a> | 4 | 4.2 (10) (For consistency, use distances from the previous column. Remember to start from node S) |
| <a id='10'>10</a> | 5 | 5.2 (10) (For b do not use path compression, and if there is a tie in rank when doing union, make the first alphabetical node the root) |
| <a id='11'>11</a> | 5 | 5.13 (5), 5.14 (5) |
| <a id='12'>12</a> | 5 | 5.26 (5), 5.28 (5) Some editions of the book have these problem numbers off by 1. The first problem should start with “Here’s a problem…” and the second with “Alice wants to…” |
