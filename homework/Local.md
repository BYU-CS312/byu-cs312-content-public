### Homework Assignment #21 â€“ Local Search

Design a local search algorithm for the 0 - 1 knapsack problem. Assume there are $n$ items $x_{1}\ldots x_{n}$ each with weight $w_{i}$ and value $v_{i}$. The knapsack can have at most one of each item and the total weight cannot exceed $W$. You want to maximize the total value in the knapsack.

**Question 1 (7)**:  
Show the psuedocode/explanation for your algorithm.

**Question 2 (3)**:  
Is it guaranteed to find an optimal solution? Justify your answer.
