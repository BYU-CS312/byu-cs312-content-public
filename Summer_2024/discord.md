# CS312 Discord Server 

We will use Discord for class communication. This is a closed forum for class-members only, and you should have received an invitation in your BYU email. 

You can always leave the server at any time (and, in particular, when the class is over.)

## Setup

Once you have joined the CS 312 server, you will only have access to the "welcome" channel. 
To get access to the other channels, please type `@ta` followed by your preffered first name and last name (e.g. `@ta Shane Reese`).

The `@ta` will notify the TAs of your message. They will then set your server nickname (the name your classmates will see) to the name you provide.
They will also add you to the other channels on the server.

We also encourage you to set your avatar (the image associated with your account) to a picture of yourself.

Consider this a professional chat forum. Present yourself accordingly. 

## Forum Guidelines

This group forum is intended to be a resource for exchanging
 ideas relating to CS 312. Feel free to collaborate and post
 useful tips, answer each others' questions, share ideas, etc., but, of course, DO NOT
 post homework answers or code for the projects.
 Please keep your communications in line with the syllabus'
 statement on working together.
