### Homework Assignment #1

Show all work neatly.

**Question 1 (6)**:  
Do 0.1 (a-f, m) from the text

**Question 2 (Bonus)**:  
You get extra credit if you can do 0.2 from the text. At least give it a good try. Hint: If c ≠ 1, the “closed form” formula for a geometric series is

$$g(n) = \frac{1 - c^{n+1}}{1 - c} = \frac{c^{n+1} - 1}{c - 1}$$

**Question 3 (4)**:  
The Fabonacci series (named after the lesser know cousin of Fibonacci) is $$f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) * f(n-3)$$ for integer $n\gt2$ with $f(0)=f(1)=f(2)=1$

a) Show in psuedocode (or Python) an exponential algorithm to solve this for an arbitrary integer n. As a function of n, give a rough big O complexity class for the algorithm and justify your answer.

b) Show in psuedocode a linear algorithm to solve this for an arbitrary integer _n_. As a function of n give the exact number of adds and multiplies necessary for your algorithm to calculate $f(n)$.
